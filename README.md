## Introduction

You may train the most awesome model in the world but if you can't deploy it then people can enjoy your work. Deoployment in ML has always been an issue that we never gets discussed in courses. It is assumed that you can just do this without any training. However, in my experience, I found it not as easy to deploy my models with much flexibility. That's why I decided to create `serve-it-learn`. The idea for the name purely from  [Vincent D. Warmerdam's brain fart](https://twitter.com/fishnets88/status/1279731745483624453). 


## Installation

I prefer conda but you do you. You need at least python 3.7

1. Create environment (if you don't already have one)
    `conda create -n serve-it-learn_env python=3.7`

2. Activate it
    `conda activate serve-it-learn_env`

3. Install it
``pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ serveitlearn``
